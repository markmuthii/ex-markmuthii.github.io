# Mark Muthii | Developer. Programmer. Chronic Overthinker

This repo holds the files for my personal blog site, which can be accessed by going to [MarkMuthii.me](http:www.markmuthii.me).

## Technologies Used

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and served through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). Jekyll makes use of the [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) templating language created by Shopify.

For the theme, I am using Clean Blog Jekyll theme, developed by Startbootstrap's founder [David Miller](http://davidmiller.io), which uses Bootstrap and SCSS for styling.
